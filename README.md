OVERVIEW OF TASK 2:
Project Overview: Data Preprocessing Task
This project outlines the essential steps involved in preprocessing a dataset for machine learning. The main goal is to prepare the data to be suitable for training a machine learning model. The dataset used for this task is Churn_Modelling.csv, which contains information related to customer churn.

Steps in Data Preprocessing
Import Libraries:

The project begins with the importation of necessary libraries: numpy for numerical operations and pandas for data manipulation.
Load Dataset:

The dataset is loaded into a DataFrame using pandas.
Data Inspection:

Basic information about the dataset is inspected using the info() method to understand the structure and summary statistics.
Separating Features and Target Variable:

The features (x) and the target variable (y) are separated. Features include Geography, RowNumber, CustomerId, CreditScore, and Age, while the target variable is Exited.
Imputing Missing Values:

Missing values in the dataset are handled using SimpleImputer from sklearn.impute. The strategy used for imputing is the mean of the columns.
Encoding Categorical Data:

Categorical data is encoded to numerical values.
LabelEncoder is used to convert categorical labels into numeric form.
OneHotEncoder is used to create dummy variables for the Geography feature, which is a categorical variable.
Splitting the Dataset:

The dataset is split into training and test sets using train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. The split ratio is 80-20.
Feature Scaling:

Feature scaling is performed using StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing to standardize the features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.
This step ensures that all features contribute equally to the model's performance.
Summary
The data preprocessing task prepares the dataset for training a machine learning model. It includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, and scaling features. These steps ensure that the data is clean, well-formatted, and suitable for building robust and accurate machine learning models.
